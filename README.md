go-ami
======

``go-ami`` is an experimental rewrite of ``pyAMI`` in ``go`` to get a
feeling of what ``REST`` APIs can look like, together with multiple
sub-commands, in ``go``.

See [py-ami](https://end.web.cern.ch/end/projects/pyAMI/) for the
intended API.

Installation
------------

```
$ go get github.com/sbinet/go-ami
```
